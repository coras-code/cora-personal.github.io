
I create display photos using the keynote project, "DisplayPhotoCreation". 
I add a background and and ios device with a screenshot to the middle (using Previewed: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxh6D0zwSsw )

It seems it would be better to link each app to github and perfect the ReadMe (instead of repeating - but does raise the question whats different about the profolio and my github?). and for private projects link to the landing pages/app store.
